# Project: Tic-Tac-Toe Game (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

I created a simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns and play on a 3x3 grid, where they alternate marking "X" and "O" on the board. The game includes features like:

Responsive UI:
The game layout adjusts to different screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

Real-time Gameplay: 
Players take turns placing their marks and the game checks for a winner after each move.

Game Reset: 
After a game ends, players can restart with a single click to play again.

Minimalistic Design:
The user interface is simple and clean, allowing players to focus on the game.

This project helped me practice my skills in JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and CSS styling while delivering a smooth and fun user experience. It also demonstrates my ability to build interactive web applications from scratch.

Feel free to try out the game and let me know your thoughts!
